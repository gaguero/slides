# Drip Campaign Context

I want you to tell me as much as you can about this. See it from many different points of view. Make a long list of points like: psychology, ui designer, grammar, a very very long list. So you produce so much information about this but very focused on what is in there and all ypu can see in the image  
You said:  
Here is the email conversation. Pero now o ly respond: got it!

Hello everyone, the following six emails are my initial proposal for the update to the drip campaign

I would love to read your thoughts:


1. The first email is a fully new, and is basically a template created by Kelly that we have been using for a while and its the result of several tests for best response we have done "manually" through time, this template includes a section about offers that we will need to keep updated when offers expire and so on, which is what we normally do anyways.

2. Emails 2 through 6 are basically the original drip campaign, with only the minimum necessary text edits applied to change the voice from a "team" or "manager" to the assigned agent ("I," "me," "my") and redirecting contact to the agent's email, thereby avoiding any changes to the core ideas or descriptive text.  
Remember the emails 2 to 5 have originally images thats why they might seem weird to read withouthem

Hello everyone,

Attached are the five emails that comprise our current drip campaign for new leads who fill out a form on our website.

As we discussed in our last meeting, we will be requesting the HubSpot team to make some changes to these emails. Our agreement was to update them to be more personalized, with the assigned agent directly addressing the lead to foster a stronger "human connection" and potentially improve response rates. Additionally, we want these emails to be sent from the assigned agent's email address to ensure quicker response times through their inbox, rather than the general guest experience inbox. We also plan to review and potentially rewrite portions of the text in all the emails.

I can start drafting new versions, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could all read the current emails. This will help us understand the original intent and how we aim to improve them. Please send me your notes and ideas for the first draft.

Best

OK attached are the 5 emails of the current drip campaing. 

Now you have the entire context. 

Repeat the instrcutions from the first message I sent  
Thought for 32s  
You said:  
go  
You said:  
We have two forms. one is called  Get Exclusive Offers and the other is called You need assistance?,  what we currently have for the firstemail it will automatically go to the GEO form, the YNA forms will require the agents to personalize the template manually as this form collects more information like dates and messages. the agent should be able to initializi the rest of the drip campaing after sending the first one tailored. 

It is important to remembeer that the agresivivity Dan the owner wants  us as sales agents is that we email, send them SMS and ring their phones as soon as we have their info. and so we do and tat first email is our trusted most succesfull first email after our time on the job, so on top of us they are receiving the drip campaign, so messy. .


The first email might look heavy, but it has been very efficient on our experience, of course it could be edited if needed. 


Our objetive with this is that we stratighten the way we communicate with the people that fill up our forms. 

You said:  
in the current behaivor, both forms auotmate the drip campain, my proposal is that the GEO automate the new drip version, and YNA requires agent customization of the new first email of the campaing as the YNA have more details, the GEO has only email and maybe phone.

in our curren manula mode  the first email we send is what we are now adding as first email for the drip campaing.
